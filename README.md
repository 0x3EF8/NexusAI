## Installation & Setup  

### 1. Clone the Repository  

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:  

\`\`\`bash  
git clone https://github.com/0x3EF8/NexusAI-Phi3.git  
cd NexusAI-Phi3  
\`\`\`  

### 2. Install Dependencies  

Use \`pip\` to install the required Python libraries. You may use a virtual environment for isolation (optional but recommended).  

#### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional):  

\`\`\`bash  
python -m venv venv  
# On Linux/macOS  
source venv/bin/activate  
# On Windows  
venv\Scripts\activate  
\`\`\`  

#### Install Dependencies:  

\`\`\`bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
\`\`\`  

### 3. Download the Model  

If the model is not found in the \`model/\` directory, it will be downloaded automatically on the first run. Alternatively, you can manually download it from [this link](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf/resolve/main/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf) and place it in the \`model/\` directory.

## Configuration  

NexusAI-Phi3 offers several configuration constants to customize its behavior:  

### Core Configuration Constants  

\`\`\`python  
MODEL_FILENAME = "Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf"  # The AI model used for response generation  
MODEL_DIRECTORY = "model"  # Directory where the model is stored  
MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH = 4096  # Maximum context length for the AI  
NUM_THREADS = 8  # Number of CPU threads allocated  
GPU_LAYERS = 35  # Number of layers offloaded to the GPU for processing  
MAX_TOKENS = 2048  # Maximum tokens for each AI response  
MODEL_URL = "https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf/resolve/main/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf"  # Download URL for the model  
\`\`\`  

### Custom Initialization Prompt  

You can customize the assistant's behavior by modifying the initialization prompt:  

\`\`\`python  
CUSTOM_PROMPT = "From now on, your name is NexusAI, developed by 0x3ef8. Act as an advanced assistant with expertise in programming concepts, tools, and best practices. Provide detailed, efficient responses."  
\`\`\`  

### Conversation History  

Limit the number of recent interactions stored in memory:  

\`\`\`python  
MAX_HISTORY_SIZE = 10  # Maximum number of recent interactions stored  
\`\`\`  

### Monitoring and Analytics  

Enable or disable detailed response time tracking and request monitoring:  

\`\`\`python  
ENABLE_MONITORING = True  # Enable detailed response time and request tracking  
\`\`\`  

---

## Running NexusAI  

To start NexusAI, run the following command:  

\`\`\`bash  
python Nexus.py  
\`\`\`  

### Example Interaction
